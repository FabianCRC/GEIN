# Project GEIN
About GEIN:
GEIN is an inventory manager project that I'm working on in order to learn about development during the time I'm working on it.
The project at the moment is going to be a web solution using API REST and other technologies that seem useful to me.
The idea is to question, apply and understand better ways to develop software.
Now i'm using .NET 7 and Entity Framework Core in the API applying Repository Pattern, N-Layers.Generics and AutoMapper and at the FrontEnd side a WebAPI using Razor and Bootstrap.
